##Game Description:

This project involved creating a simple game of "Tic-Tac-Toe" or "Noughts and Crosses" for any UK users.

Tic-tac-toe is a game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

##Main Features:

The game allows two users to alternate placing X's and O's on the game board by clicking the individual squares on the board.

The game prompts the player when it is there turn. If a player manages to place three in a row, there is a winner and the game alerts who the winner is.

It also keeps track of the scores between the players.

There is a reset button to re-set the board.

##Known bugs:

If the screen is minimised, the player board doesn't re-size correctly.

##Languages / Frameworks used:
